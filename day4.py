# Commentary
#
# Two fun pieces here. The first is the win condition checkâ€”full match in any row or column. We already know how to
# create columns from rows using zip(*rows), the is_winner function just builds on this with set()s to check whether
# the row (or column) is a full subset of the called numbers so far. We use any() to return true if any of them are
# full subsets.
#
# The second piece is calculating the sum of all uncalled numbers on the board. We use itertools.chain(*board) to
# "flatten" the rows into a single list, then we use set.difference() to get the subset that aren't matched and sum
# them.
